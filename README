Welcome to "mu"
===============

mu is a set of utilities to deal with Maildirs, specifically, 
indexing and searching. 

- mu-index - recursively scans a collection of email messages, and
stores information found in a database.

- mu-find - searches for messages based on some search criteria.

- mu-msginfo - gives information (such as subject, sender, message body) for a
  certain message file

- mu-mkmdir - creates a new Maildir

mu uses libgmime2 to parse the message, and SQLite and Xapian to store the
message data.
