mu4e manual
***********

   Welcome to mu4e!

   mu4e (mu-for-emacs) is an e-mail client for GNU-Emacs version 23 and
later, built on top of the mu(1) e-mail search engine. mu4e is
optimized for fast handling of large amounts of e-mail.

   Some of mu4e's highlights:

   * Fully search-based: there are no folders(2), only queries

   * Fully documented, with example configurations

   * User-interface optimized for speed, with quick key strokes for
     common actions

   * Support for non-English languages (so "angstrom" will match
     "Ångström")

   * Asynchronous; heavy actions don't block `emacs'(3)

   * Support for crypto

   * Writing rich-text e-mails using org-mode

   * Address auto-completion based on the contacts in your messages

   * Extendable with your own snippets of elisp

   In this manual, we go through the installation of mu4e, do some basic
configuration and explain its daily use. We also show you how you can
customize mu4e for your needs.

   At the end of the manual, there are some example configurations, to
get you up to speed quickly: *note Example configurations::. There's
also an *note FAQ::, which should help you with some common questions.

File: mu4e.info,  Node: Why another e-mail client,  Next: Other mail clients,  Up: Introduction

1.1 Why another e-mail client?
==============================

Fair question.

   I'm not sure the world needs yet another e-mail client, but perhaps
_I_ do! I (the author) spend a _lot_ of time dealing with e-mail, both
professionally and privately. Having an efficient e-mail client is
essential.  Since none of the existing ones worked the way I wanted, I
created my own. `emacs' is an integral part of my workflow, so it made
a lot of sense to use it for e-mail as well. And as I already had
written an e-mail search engine (mu), it seemed only logical to use
that as a basis.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Other mail clients,  Next: What mu4e does not do,  Prev: Why another e-mail client,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Other mail clients
======================

Under the hood, mu4e is fully search-based, similar to programs like
notmuch(1), md(2) and sup(3). However, mu4e's user-interface is quite
different. mu4e's mail handling (deleting, moving etc.) is inspired by
_Wanderlust_(4) (another `emacs'-based e-mail client), mutt(5) and
dired.

   mu4e tries to keep all the 'state' in your maildirs, so you can
easily switch between clients, synchronize over IMAP, backup with rsync
and so on. If you delete the database, you won't lose any information.

File: mu4e.info,  Node: What mu4e does not do,  Next: Becoming a mu4e user,  Prev: Other mail clients,  Up: Introduction

1.3 What mu4e does not do
=========================

There are a number of things that mu4e does _not_ do:
   * mu/mu4e do _not_ deal with getting your e-mail messages from a
     mail server. That task is delegated to other tools, such as
     offlineimap(1), isync(2) or fetchmail(3). As long as the messages
     end up in a maildir, mu4e and mu are happy to deal with them.

   * mu4e also does _not_ implement sending of messages; instead, it
     depends on smptmail (*note (smtpmail)Top::), which is part of
     `emacs'. In addition, mu4e piggybacks on Gnus' message editor;
     *note (message)Top::.

   Thus, many of the things an e-mail client traditionally needs to do,
are delegated to other tools. This leaves mu4e to concentrate on what
it does best: quickly finding the mails you are looking for, and handle
them as efficiently as possible.

1.4 Becoming a mu4e user
========================

If mu4e looks like something for you, give it a shot! We've been trying
hard to make it as easy as possible to set up and use; and while you
can use elisp in various places to augment mu4e, a lot of knowledge
about programming or elisp shouldn't be required.

   When you take mu4e into use, it's a good idea to subscribe to the
mu/mu4e-mailing list(1).

   If you have suggestions for improvements or bug reports, please use
the GitHub issues list(2). In bug reports, please clearly specify the
versions of mu/mu4e and `emacs' you are using, as well as any other
relevant details. If you are new to all this, the somewhat
paternalistic _"How to ask questions the smart way"_(3) can be a good
read.

2 Getting started
*****************

In this chapter, we go through the installation of mu4e and its basic
setup. After we have succeeded in *note Getting mail::, and *note
Indexing your messages::, we discuss *note Basic configuration::.

   After these steps, mu4e should be ready to go!

File: mu4e.info,  Node: Requirements,  Next: Installation,  Up: Getting started

2.1 Requirements
================

mu/mu4e are known to work on a wide variety of Unix- and Unix-like
systems, including many Linux distributions, MacOS and FreeBSD. `emacs'
23 or 24 is required, as well as Xapian(1) and GMime(2).

   mu has optional support the Guile 2.x (Scheme) programming language.
There are also some GUI-tools, which require GTK+ and Webkit; either
the GTK+2 or GTK+3-versions.

   If you intend to compile it yourself, you need to have the typical
development tools, such as C and C++ compilers (both `gcc' and `clang'
should work), GNU Autotools and `make', and (if you use them) the
development packages for GTK+, Webkit and Guile.

   (2) `http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime/'


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Getting mail,  Prev: Requirements,  Up: Getting started

2.2 Installation
================

mu4e is part of mu - by installing the latter, the former is installed
as well. Some Linux distributions provide packaged versions of mu/mu4e;
if you can use those, there is no need to compile anything yourself.
However, if there are no packages for your distribution, if they are
outdated, or if you want to use the latest development versions, you can
follow the steps below.

   First, you need make sure you have the necessary dependencies; the
details depend on your distribution. If you're using another
distribution (or another OS), the below at least be helpful in
identifying the packages to install.

   We provide some instructions for Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora; if those
do not apply to you, you can follow either *note Building from a
release tarball:: or *note Building from git::.

2.2.1 Dependencies for Debian/Ubuntu
------------------------------------

     $ sudo apt-get install libgmime-2.6-dev libxapian-dev
     # if libgmime-2.6-dev is not available, try libgmime-2.4-dev

     # get emacs 23 or 24 if you don't have it yet
     # emacs 24 works better; it may be available as 'emacs-snapshot'
     $ sudo apt-get install emacs23

     # optional
     $ sudo apt-get install guile-2.0-dev html2text xdg-utils

     # optional: only needed for msg2pdf and mug (toy gtk+ frontend)
     $ sudo apt-get install libwebkit-dev

2.2.2 Dependencies for Fedora
-----------------------------

     $ sudo yum install gmime-devel xapian-core-devel

     # get emacs 23 or 24 if you don't have it yet
     $ sudo yum install emacs

     # optional
     $ sudo yum install html2text xdg-utils

     # optional: only needed for msg2pdf and mug (toy gtk+ frontend)
     $ sudo apt-get install webkitgtk-devel
     #   or:
     $ sudo apt-get install webkitgtk3-devel

2.2.3 Building from a release tarball
-------------------------------------

Using a release-tarball (as available from GoogleCode(1), installation
follows the normal steps:

     $ tar xvfz mu-<version>.tar.gz  # use the specific version
     $ cd mu-<version>
     # On the BSDs: use gmake instead of make
     $ ./configure && make
     $ sudo make install

   Xapian, GMime and their dependencies must be installed.

2.2.4 Building from git
-----------------------

Alternatively, if you build from the git repository or use a tarball
like the ones that github produces, the instructions are slightly
different, and require you to have autotools installed:

     # get from git (alternatively, use a github tarball)
     $ git clone git://github.com/djcb/mu.git

     $ cd mu
     $ autoreconf -i && ./configure && make
     # On the BSDs: use gmake instead of make
     $ sudo make install

   (Xapian, GMime and their dependencies must be installed).

   After this, mu and mu4e should be installed (2) on your system, and
be available from the command line in `emacs'.

   You may need to restart `emacs', so it can find mu4e in its
`load-path'. If, even after restarting, `emacs' cannot find mu4e, you
may need to add to your `load-path' explicitly; check where mu4e is
installed, and add something like the following to your configuration
before trying again:
     ;; the exact path may differ -- check it
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")

2.2.5 mu4e and emacs customization
----------------------------------

There is some support for using the `emacs' customization system in
mu4e, but for now, we recommend setting the values manually. Please
refer to *note Example configurations:: for a couple of examples of
this; here we go through things step-by-step.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `http://code.google.com/p/mu0/downloads/list'

   (2) there's a hard dependency between versions of mu4e and mu - you
cannot combine different versions


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Getting mail,  Next: Indexing your messages,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Getting started

2.3 Getting mail
================

In order for mu (and, by extension, mu4e) to work, you need to have
your e-mail messages stored in a _maildir_(1) - a specific directory
structure with one-file-per-message. If you are already using a
maildir, you are lucky. If not, some setup is required:

   * _Using an external IMAP or POP server_ - if you are using an IMAP
     or POP server, you can use tools like getmail, fetchmail,
     offlineimap or isync to download your messages into a maildir
     (`~/Maildir', often). Because it is such a common case, there is a
     full example of setting mu4e up with offlineimap and Gmail; *note
     Gmail configuration::.

   * _Using a local mail server_ - if you are using a local mail-server
     (such as postfix or qmail), you can teach them to deliver into a
     maildir as well, maybe in combination with procmail. A bit of
     googling should be able to provide you with the details.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir'; in this manual we use
the term 'maildir' for both the standard and the hierarchy of maildirs
that store your messages


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Indexing your messages,  Next: Basic configuration,  Prev: Getting mail,  Up: Getting started

2.4 Indexing your messages
==========================

After you have succeeded in *note Getting mail::, we need to _index_ the
messages. That is - we need to scan the message in the maildir and
store the information about the mails into a special database. We can
do that from mu4e - *note Main view::, but the first time, it is a good
idea to run it from the command line, to make sure everything works
correctly.

   Assuming that your maildir is at `~/Maildir', we give the following
command:
       $ mu index --maildir=~/Maildir

   This should scan your `~/Maildir'(1) and fill the database, and give
progress information while doing so.

   The indexing process may take a few minutes the first time you do it
(for thousands of e-mails); afterwards it is much faster, since mu only
scans messages that are new or have changed. Indexing is discussed in
full detail in the mu-index man page.

   After the indexing process has finished, you can quickly test if
everything worked, by trying some command-line searches, for example
       $ mu find hello

   which should list all messages that match hello. For more examples of
searches, see *note Queries::, or check the mu-find and mu-easy man
pages. If all of this worked well, we are well on our way setting up mu;
the next step is to do some basic configuration for mu4e.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In most cases, you do not even need to provide the
-maildir=~/Maildir since it is the default; see the mu-index man-page
for details


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Basic configuration,  Next: Folders,  Prev: Indexing your messages,  Up: Getting started

2.5 Basic configuration
=======================

Before we can start using mu4e, we need to tell `emacs' to load it. So,
add to your `~/.emacs' (or its moral equivalent, such as
`~/.emacs.d/init.el') something like:

     (require 'mu4e)

   If `emacs' complains that it cannot find mu4e, check your
`load-path' and make sure that mu4e's installation directory is part of
it. If not, you can add it:

     (add-to-list 'load-path MU4E-PATH)

   with MU4E-PATH replaced with the actual path.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Folders,  Next: Retrieval and indexing,  Prev: Basic configuration,  Up: Getting started

2.6 Folders
===========

The next step is to tell mu4e where it can find your Maildir, and some
special folders. So, for example(1):
       ;; these are actually the defaults
       (setq
         mu4e-maildir       "~/Maildir"   ;; top-level Maildir
         mu4e-sent-folder   "/sent"       ;; folder for sent messages
         mu4e-drafts-folder "/drafts"     ;; unfinished messages
         mu4e-trash-folder  "/trash"      ;; trashed messages
         mu4e-refile-folder "/archive")   ;; saved messages

   `mu4e-maildir' takes an actual filesystem-path, the other folder
names are all relative to `mu4e-maildir'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that the folders (mu4e-sent-folder, mu4e-drafts-folder,
mu4e-trash-folder and mu4e-refile-folder) can also be _functions_ that
are evaluated at runtime. This allows for dynamically changing them
depending on context. See *note Dynamic folders:: for details.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Retrieval and indexing,  Next: Sending mail,  Prev: Folders,  Up: Getting started

2.7 Retrieval and indexing
==========================

As we have seen, we can do all of the mail retrieval _outside_ of
`emacs'/mu4e. However, you can also do it from within mu4e. For that,
set the variable `mu4e-get-mail-command' to the program or shell
command you want to use for retrieving mail. You can then retrieve your
e-mail using `M-x mu4e-update-mail-and-index', or `C-S-u' in all
mu4e-views.

   If you don't have a specific command for getting mail, for example
because you are running your own mail-server, you can set
`mu4e-get-mail-command' to "true", in which case mu4e won't try to get
new mail, but still re-index your messages.

   You can also update your mail and index periodically in the
background, by setting the variable `mu4e-update-interval' to the
number of seconds between these updates. If set to `nil', it won't
update at all. After you make changes to `mu4e-update-interval', mu4e
must be restarted before the changes take effect.

   A simple setup could look something like:

     (setq
        mu4e-get-mail-command "offlineimap"   ;; or fetchmail, or ...
        mu4e-update-interval 300)             ;; update every 5 minutes

   It is possible to get notifications when the indexing process does
any updates - for example when receiving new mail. See
`mu4e-index-updated-hook' and some tips on its usage in the *note FAQ::.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Sending mail,  Next: Running mu4e,  Prev: Retrieval and indexing,  Up: Getting started

2.8 Sending mail
================

mu4e re-uses Gnu's `message-mode' (*note (message)Top::) for writing
mail and inherits the setup for sending mail as well.

   For sending mail using SMTP, mu4e uses smtpmail (*note
(smtpmail)Top::). This package supports many different ways to send
mail; please refer to its documentation for the details.

   Here, we only provide some simple examples - for more, see *note
Example configurations::.

   A very minimal setup:

     ;; tell message-mode how to send mail
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     ;; if our mail server lives at smtp.example.org; if you have a local
     ;; mail-server, simply use 'localhost' here.
     (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.example.org")

   Since mu4e (re)uses the same message mode and smtpmail that Gnus
uses, many settings for those also apply to mu4e.

2.8.1 Dealing with sent messages
--------------------------------

By default, mu4e puts a copy of messages you sent in the folder
determined by `mu4e-sent-folder'.  In some cases, this may not be what
you want - for example, when using Gmail-over-IMAP, this interferes
with Gmail's handling of the sent messages folder, and you may end up
with duplicate messages.

   You can use the the variable `mu4e-sent-messages-behavior' to
customize what happens with sent messages. The default is the symbol
`sent' which, as mentioned, causes the message to be copied to your
sent-messages folder. Other possible values are the symbols `trash'
(the sent message is moved to the trash-folder (`mu4e-trash-folder'),
and `delete' to simply discard the sent message altogether (so GMail
can deal with it).

   For Gmail-over-IMAP, you could add the following to your settings:
;; don't save messages to Sent Messages, Gmail/IMAP takes care of this
(setq mu4e-sent-messages-behavior 'delete)
 And that's it! We should now be ready to go.

2.9 Running mu4e
================

After following the steps in this chapter, we hopely now have a working
mu4e setup. Great! In the next chapters, we walk you through the various
views in mu4e.

   For your orientation, the diagram below shows how the views relate
to each other, and the default key-bindings to navigate between them.

3 The main view
***************

After you have installed mu4e (*note Getting started::), you can start
it with `M-x mu4e'. mu4e does some checks to ensure everything is set up
correctly, and then shows you the mu4e main view. Its major mode is
`mu4e-main-mode'.

* Menu:

* MV Overview::
* Basic actions::
* MV Bookmarks::
* Miscellaneous::


File: mu4e.info,  Node: MV Overview,  Next: Basic actions,  Up: Main view

3.1 Overview
============

The main view looks something like the following:

    * mu4e - mu for emacs version x.x CG

      Basics

            * [j]ump to some maildir
            * enter a [s]earch query
            * [C]ompose a new message

      Bookmarks

            * [bu] Unread messages
            * [bt] Today's messages
            * [bw] Last 7 days
            * [bp] Messages with images
      Misc

            * [U]pdate email & database
            * toggle [m]ail sending mode (direct)
            * [f]lush queued mail

            * [A]bout mu4e
            * [H]elp
            * [q]uit mu4e

   In the example above, you can see the letters "CG", which indicate:
   * C: support for decryption of encrypted messages, and verifying
     signatures. See *note MSGV Crypto:: in the *note Message view::
     for details.

   * G: support for the Guile 2.0 programming language
   Whether you see both, one or none of these letters depends on the
way mu is built.

   Let's walk through the menu.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Basic actions,  Next: MV Bookmarks,  Prev: MV Overview,  Up: Main view

3.2 Basic actions
=================

First, the _Basics_:
   * [j]ump to some maildir: after pressing <j> ("jump"), mu4e asks you
     for a maildir to visit. These are the maildirs you set in *note
     Basic configuration:: and any of your own. If you choose <o>
     ("other") or </>, you can choose from all maildirs under
     `mu4e-maildir'. After choosing a maildir, the messages in that
     maildir are listed, in the *note Headers view::.

   * enter a [s]earch query: after pressing <s>, mu4e asks you for a
     search query, and after entering one, shows the results in the
     *note Headers view::.

   Some notes to explain what you see in the example:

   * The fields shown in the headers view can be influenced by
     customizing the variable `mu4e-headers-fields'; see
     `mu4e-header-info' for the list of available fields.

   * By default, the date is shown with the :human-date field, which
     shows the _time_ for today's messages, and the _date_ for older
     messages. If you want to distinguish between 'today' and 'older',
     you can use the :date field instead.

   * You can customize the date and time formats with the variable
     `mu4e-headers-date-format' and `mu4e-headers-time-format',
     respectively. In the example, we use `:human-date', which shows
     when the time when the message was sent today, and the date
     otherwise.

   * The header field used for sorting is indicated by "V" or "^"(1),
     indicating the sort order (descending or ascending, respectively).
     You can influence this by a mouse click, or <O>. Not all fields
     allow sorting.

   * Instead of showing the From: and To: fields separately, you can
     use From/To (:from-or-to in `mu4e-headers-fields' as a more
     compact way to convey the most important information: it shows
     From: _except_ when the e-mail was sent by the user (i.e., you) -
     in that case it shows To: (prefixed by To(2), as in the example
     above). To determine whether a message was sent by you, mu4e uses
     the variable `mu4e-user-mail-address-list', a list of your e-mail
     addresses.

   * The 'List' field shows the mailing-list a message is sent to;
     `mu4e' tries to create a convenient shortcut for the mailing-list
     name; the variable `mu4e-user-mailing-lists' can be used to add
     your own shortcuts.

   * The letters in the 'Flags' field correspond to the following:
     D=_draft_, F=_flagged_ (i.e., 'starred'), N=_new_, P=_passed_
     (i.e., forwarded), R=_replied_, S=_seen_, T=_trashed_,
     a=_has-attachment_, x=_encrypted_, s=_signed_, u=_unread_. The
     tooltip for this field also contains this information.

   * The subject field also indicates the discussion threads (3).

   * The headers view is _automatically updated_ if any changes are
     found during the indexing process, and if there is not current
     user-interaction. If you do not want such automatic updates, set
     `mu4e-headers-auto-update' to `nil'.

File: mu4e.info,  Node: Marking messages,  Next: Sort order and threading,  Prev: Keybindings,  Up: Headers view

4.3 Marking messages
====================

When processing messages, the first step is to _mark_ them for a certain
action, such as deletion or move. Then, after one or more messages are
marked, you execute (`mu4e-mark-execute-all', <x>) these actions. This
two-step mark-execute sequence is similar to what e.g. dired does. This
is how mu4e tries to be as quick as possible, while avoiding accidents.

   The mark/unmark commands support the _region_ (i.e., "selection") -
so, for example, if you select some messages and press <DEL>, all
messages in the region are marked for deletion.

   You can mark all messages that match a certain pattern with <%>. In
addition, you can mark all messages in the current thread (<T>) or
sub-thread (<t>).

   When you do a new search or refresh the headers buffer while you
still have marked messages, you are asked what to do with those marks -
whether to _apply_ them before leaving, or _ignore_ them. This behavior
can be influenced with the variable `mu4e-headers-leave-behavior'.

   For more information about marking, see *note Marking::.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Sort order and threading,  Next: HV Actions,  Prev: Marking messages,  Up: Headers view

4.4 Sort order and threading
============================

By default, mu4e sorts messages by date, in descending order: the most
recent messages are shown at the top. In addition, the messages are
_threaded_, i.e., shown in the context of a discussion thread; this also
affects the sort order.

   The header field used for sorting is indicated by "V" or "^"(1),
indicating the sort order (descending or ascending, respectively).

   You can change the sort order by clicking the corresponding field
with the mouse, or with `M-x mu4e-headers-change-sorting' (<O>); note
that not all fields can be used for sorting. You can toggle threading
on/off using `M-x mu4e-headers-toggle-threading' or <P>. For both of
these functions, unless you provide a prefix argument (<C-u>), the
current search is updated immediately using the new parameters. You can
toggle full-search (*note Searching::) using `M-x
mu4e-headers-toggle-full-search' or <Q>.

   If you want to change the defaults for these settings, you can use
the variables `mu4e-headers-sortfield' and `mu4e-headers-show-threads'.

File: mu4e.info,  Node: HV Actions,  Next: Split view,  Prev: Sort order and threading,  Up: Headers view

4.5 Actions
===========

`mu4e-headers-action' (<a>) lets you pick custom actions to perform on
the message at point. You can specify these actions using the variable
`mu4e-headers-actions'. See *note Actions:: for the details.

   mu4e defines some default actions. One of those is for _capturing_ a
message: <a c> 'captures' the current message. Next, when you're editing
some message, you can include the previously captured message as an
attachment, using `mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message'. See
`mu4e-actions.el' in the mu4e source distribution for more example
actions.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Split view,  Prev: HV Actions,  Up: Headers view

4.6 Split view
==============

Using the _Split view_, we can see the *note Headers view:: and the
*note Message view:: next to each other, with the message selected in
the former, visible in the latter. You can influence the way the
splitting is done by customizing the variable `mu4e-split-view'.
Possible values are:

   * horizontal (this is the default): display the message view below
     the header view. Use `mu4e-headers-visible-lines' the set the
     number of lines shown (default: 8).

   * vertical: display the message view on the right side of the header
     view. Use `mu4e-headers-visible-columns' to set the number of
     visible columns (default: 30).

   * anything else: don't do any splitting

Some useful key bindings in the split view:
   * <C-+> and <C->: interactively change the number of columns or
     headers shown

   * You can change the selected window from the headers-view to the
     message-view and vice-versa with `mu4e-select-other-view', bound
     to <y>

   Some notes:
   * The variable `mu4e-view-fields' determines the header fields to be
     shown.

   * You can set the date format with the variable
     `mu4e-date-format-long'.

   * By default, only the names of contacts in address fields are
     visible (see `mu4e-view-show-addresses' to change this). You can
     view the e-mail addresses by clicking on the name, or pressing
     <M-RET>.

   * You can compose a message for the contact at point by either
     clicking <[mouse-2]> or pressing <C>.

   * The body text can be line-wrapped using longlines-mode. mu4e
     defines <w> to toggle between the wrapped and unwrapped state. If
     you want to do this automatically when viewing a message, invoke
     `longlines-mode' in your `mu4e-view-mode-hook'.

   * You can hide cited parts in messages (the parts starting with ">")
     using `mu4e-view-hide-cited', bound to <h>. If you want to do this
     automatically for every message, invoke the function in your
     `mu4e-view-mode-hook'.

   * For search-related operations, see *note Searching::.

   * You can scroll down the message using <SPC>; if you do this at the
     end of a message,it automatically takes you to the next one. If
     you want to prevent this behavior, set `mu4e-view-scroll-to-next'

File: mu4e.info,  Node: Opening and saving attachments,  Next: Viewing images inline,  Prev: MSGV Keybindings,  Up: Message view

5.3 Opening and saving attachments
==================================

By default, mu4e uses the xdg-open-program (1) or (on MacOS) the open
program for opening attachments. If you want to use another program,
you do so by setting the MU_PLAY_PROGRAM environment variable to the
program to be used.

   The default directory for extracting (saving) attachments is your
home directory (`~/'); you can change this using the variable
`mu4e-attachment-dir', for example:

     (setq mu4e-attachment-dir  "~/Downloads")

   For more flexibility, `mu4e-attachment-dir' can also be a
user-provided function. This function receives two parameters: the
file-name and the mime-type(2) of the attachment, either or both of
which can be nil. For example:

     (setq mu4e-attachment-dir
       (lambda (fname mtype)
         (cond
           ;; docfiles go to ~/Desktop
           ((and fname (string-match "\\.doc$" fname))  "~/Desktop")
           ;; ... other cases  ...
           (t "~/Downloads")))) ;; everything else

   You can extract multiple attachments at once by prefixing the
extracting command by <C-u>; so `C-u e' asks you for a range of
attachments to extract (for example, `1 3-6 8'). The range "`a'" is a
shortcut for _all_ attachments.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (2) sadly, often application/octet-stream is used for the mime-type,
even if a better type is available


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Viewing images inline,  Next: Displaying rich-text messages,  Prev: Opening and saving attachments,  Up: Message view

5.4 Viewing images inline
=========================

It is possible to show images inline in the message view buffer if you
run `emacs' in GUI-mode. You can enable this by setting the variable
`mu4e-view-show-images' to t. Since `emacs' does not always handle
images correctly, this is not enabled by default. If you are using
`emacs' 24 with _ImageMagick_(1) support, make sure you call
`imagemagick-register-types' in your configuration, so it is used for
images.

     ;; enable inline images
     (setq mu4e-view-show-images t)
     ;; use imagemagick, if available
     (when (fboundp 'imagemagick-register-types)
        (imagemagick-register-types))

File: mu4e.info,  Node: Displaying rich-text messages,  Next: MSGV Crypto,  Prev: Viewing images inline,  Up: Message view

5.5 Displaying rich-text messages
=================================

mu4e normally prefers the plain-text version for messages that consist
of both a plain-text and html (rich-text) versions of the body-text.
You change this by setting `mu4e-view-prefer-html' to t.

   If there is only an html-version, or if the plain-text version is
too short in comparison with the html part(1), mu4e tries to convert
the html into plain-text for display. The default way to do that is to
use the `emacs' built-in `html2text' function. However, you can set the
variable `mu4e-html2text-command' to use some external program instead.
This program is expected to take html from standard input and write
plain text in utf-8 encoding on standard output.

   An example of such a program is the program that is actually _called_
html2text(2). After installation, you can set it up with something like
the following:

     (setq mu4e-html2text-command "html2text -utf8 -width 72")

   An alternative to this is the Python python-html2text package; after
installing that, you can tell mu4e to use it with something like:

     (setq mu4e-html2text-command
        "html2markdown | grep -v '&nbsp_place_holder;'")

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) this is for the case where the text-part only warns that you
should use the html-version

File: mu4e.info,  Node: MSGV Crypto,  Next: MSGV Actions,  Prev: Displaying rich-text messages,  Up: Message view

5.6 Crypto
==========

The mu4e message view supports(1) decryption of encrypted messages, as
well as verification of signatures. For signing/encrypting messages
your outgoing messages, see *note Signing and encrypting::.

   Currently, only PGP/MIME is supported; PGP-inline and S/MIME are not.

   For all of this to work, `gpg-agent' must be running, and it must set
the environment variable GPG_AGENT_INFO. You can check from `emacs'
with <M-x getenv GPG_AGENT_INFO>.

   In many mainstream Linux/Unix desktop environments, everything works
out-of-the-box, but if your environment does not automatically start
`gpg-agent', you can do so by hand:
$ eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)

This starts the daemon, and sets the environment variable.

5.6.1 Decryption
----------------

If you receive messages that are encrypted (using PGP/MIME), mu4e can
try to decrypt them, base on the setting of `mu4e-decryption-policy'.
If you set it to t, mu4e attempts to decrypt messages automatically;
this is the default. If you set it to nil, mu4e _won't_ attempt to
decrypt anything. Finally, if you set it to 'ask, it asks you what to
do, each time an encrypted message is encountered.

   When opening an encrypted message, mu consults gpg-agent to see if it
already has unlocked the key needed to decrypt the message; if not, it
prompts you for a password (typically with a separate top-level
window). This is only needed once per session.

5.6.2 Verifying signatures
--------------------------

Some e-mail messages are cryptographically signed, and mu4e can check
the validity of these signatures. If a message has one or more
signatures, the message view shows an extra header Signature: (assuming
it is part of your `mu4e-view-fields'), and one or more 'verdicts' of
the signatures found; either verified, unverified or error. For
instance:

Signature: unverified (Details)

   You can see the details of the signature verification by activating
the Details or pressing <v>. This pops up a little window with the
details of the signatures found and whether they could be verified or
not.

   For more information, see the `mu-verify' manual page.

crypto-support; see the *note FAQ::

5.7 Actions
===========

You can perform custom functions ("actions") on messages and their
attachments. For a general discussion on how to define your own, see
see *note Actions::.

5.7.1 Message actions
---------------------

`mu4e-view-action' (<a>) lets you pick some custom action to perform on
the current message. You can specify these actions using the variable
`mu4e-view-actions'; mu4e defines a number of example actions.

5.7.2 Attachment actions
------------------------

Similarly, there is `mu4e-view-attachment-action' (<A>) for actions on
attachments, which you can specify with `mu4e-view-attachment-actions'.

   mu4e predefines a number of attachment-actions:
   * open-with (<w>): open the attachment with some arbitrary program.
     For example, suppose you have received a message with a picture
     attachment; then, `A w 1 RET gimp RET' opens that attachment in
     _The Gimp_

   * pipe (<|>: process the attachment with some Unix shell-pipe and
     see the results. Suppose you receive a patch file, and would like
     to get an overview of the changes, using the diffstat program. You
     can use something like: `A | 1 RET diffstat -b RET'.

   * `emacs' (<e>): open the attachment in your running `emacs'. For
     example, if you receive some text file you'd like to open in
     `emacs': `A e 1 RET'.

   These actions all work on a _temporary copy_ of the attachment.

6 The editor view
*****************

Writing e-mail messages takes place in the Editor View. mu4e's editor
view builds on top of Gnu's message-mode. Most of the message-mode
functionality is available, as well some mu4e-specifics. Its major mode
is `mu4e-compose-mode'.

6.2 Useful keybindings
======================

mu4e's editor view derives from Gnu's message editor and shares most of
its keybindings. Here are some of the more useful ones (you can use the
menu to find more):

key          description
---          -----------
C-c C-c      send message
C-c C-d      save to drafts and leave
C-c C-k      kill the message
C-c C-a      attach a file (pro-tip: drag & drop works as well)

(mu4e-specific)
C-S-u        update mail & reindex


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Address autocompletion,  Next: Compose hooks,  Prev: Useful keybindings,  Up: Editor view

6.3 Address autocompletion
==========================

mu4e supports(1) autocompleting addresses when composing e-mail
messages. mu4e uses the e-mail addresses from the messages you sent or
received as the source for this. Address auto-completion is enabled by
default; if you want to disable it for some reason, set
mu4e-compose-complete-addresses to nil.

   Emacs 24 also supports cycling through the alternatives. When there
are more than _5_ matching addresses, they are shown in a *Completions*
buffer. Once the number of matches gets below this number, one is
inserted in the address field and you can cycle through the
alternatives using <TAB>.

6.3.1 Limiting the number of addresses
--------------------------------------

If you have a lot of mail, especially from mailing lists and the like,
there can be a _lot_ of e-mail addresses, many of which may not be very
useful when auto-completing. For this reason, mu4e attempts to limit
the number of e-mail addresses in the completion pool by filtering out
the ones that are not likely to be relevant. The following variables
are available for tuning this:

   * `mu4e-compose-complete-only-personal' - when set to t, only
     consider addresses that were seen in _personal_ messages - that is,
     messages in which one of my e-mail addresses was seen in one of
     the address fields. This is to exclude mailing list posts. You can
     define what is considered 'my e-mail address' using
     `mu4e-user-mail-address-list', a list of e-mail address (defaults
     to `user-mail-address', and when indexing from the command line,
     the -my-address parameter for mu index.

   * `mu4e-compose-complete-only-after' - only consider e-mail
     addresses last seen after some date. Parameter is a string,
     parseable by `org-parse-time-string'. This excludes old e-mail
     addresses. The default is "2010-01-01", i.e., only consider e-mail
     addresses seen since the start of 2010.

   * `mu4e-compose-complete-ignore-address-regexp' - a regular
     expression to filter out other 'junk' e-mail addresses; defaults
     to "no-?reply".

File: mu4e.info,  Node: Compose hooks,  Next: Signing and encrypting,  Prev: Address autocompletion,  Up: Editor view

6.4 Compose hooks
=================

If you want to change some setting, or execute some custom action before
message composition starts, you can define a _hook function_. mu4e
offers two hooks:
   * `mu4e-compose-pre-hook': this hook is run _before_ composition
     starts; if you are composing a _reply_, _forward_ a message, or
     _edit_ an existing message, the variable
     `mu4e-compose-parent-message' points to the message being replied
     to, forwarded or edited, and you can use `mu4e-message-field' to
     get the value of various properties (and see *note Message
     functions::).

   * `mu4e-compose-mode-hook': this hook is run just before composition
     starts, when the whole buffer has already been set up. This is a
     good place for editing-related settings.
     `mu4e-compose-parent-message' (see above) is also at your disposal.

Let's look at some examples. First, suppose we want to set the
From:-address for a reply message based on the receiver of the original:
     ;; 1) messages to me@foo.com should be replied with From:me@foo.com
     ;; 2) messages to me@bar.com should be replied with From:me@bar.com
     ;; 3) all other mail should use From:me@cuux.com
     (add-hook 'mu4e-compose-pre-hook
       (defun my-set-from-address ()
         "Set the From address based on the To address of the original."
         (let ((msg mu4e-compose-parent-message)) ;; msg is shorter...
           (setq user-mail-address
     	(cond
               ((mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :to "me@foo.com")
                "me@foo.com")
               ((mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :to "me@bar.com")
                "me@bar.com")
     	  (t "me@cuux.com"))))))

   Second, as mentioned, `mu4e-compose-mode-hook' is especially useful
for editing-related settings. For example:
     (add-hook 'mu4e-compose-mode-hook
        (defun my-do-compose-stuff ()
           "My settings for message composition."
           (set-fill-column 72)
           (flyspell-mode)))

   This hook is also useful for adding headers or changing headers,
since the message is fully formed when this hook runs. For example, to
add a Bcc:-header, you could add something like the following, using
`message-add-header' from `message-mode'.

     (add-hook 'mu4e-compose-mode-hook
       (defun my-add-bcc ()
         "Add a Bcc: header."
         (save-excursion (message-add-header "Bcc: me@example.com\n"))))

mu4e::.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Signing and encrypting,  Next: Queuing mail,  Prev: Compose hooks,  Up: Editor view

6.5 Signing and encrypting
==========================

Signing and encrypting of messages is possible using emacs-mime (*note
(emacs-mime)Composing::), most easily accessed through the
Attachments-menu while composing a message, or with `M-x
mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgp', `M-x mml-secure-message-sign-pgp'.

   The support for encryption and signing is _independent_ of the
support for their counterparts, decrypting and signature verification
(as discussed in *note MSGV Crypto::). Even if your mu4e does have
support for the latter two, you can still sign/encrypt messages.

   Currently, decryption and signature verification only works for
PGP/MIME; inline-PGP and S/MIME are not supported.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Queuing mail,  Next: Other settings,  Prev: Signing and encrypting,  Up: Editor view

6.6 Queuing mail
================

If you cannot send mail right now, for example because you are currently
offline, you can _queue_ the mail, and send it when you have restored
your internet connection. You can control this from the *note Main
view::.

   To allow for queuing, you need to tell smtpmail where you want to
store the queued messages. For example:

     (setq smtpmail-queue-mail  nil  ;; start in non-queuing mode
           smtpmail-queue-dir   "~/Maildir/queue/cur")

   For convenience, we put the queue directory somewhere in our normal
maildir. If you want to use queued mail, you should create this
directory before starting mu4e. The `mu mkdir' command may be useful
here, so for example:

$ mu mkdir ~/Maildir/queue
$ touch ~/Maildir/queue/.noindex

   The file created by the `touch' command tells mu to ignore this
directory for indexing, which makes sense since it contains smtpmail
meta-data rather than 'normal' messages; see the mu-mkdir and mu-index
man pages for details.

   _Warning_: when you switch on queued-mode, your messages _won't_
reach their destination until you switch it off again; so, be careful
not to do this accidentally!

6.7 Other settings
==================

   * If you want use mu4e as `emacs'' default program for sending mail,
     see *note Setting the default emacs mail program::.

   * Normally, mu4e _buries_ the message buffer after sending; if you
     want to kill the buffer instead, add something like the following
     to your configuration:
          (setq message-kill-buffer-on-exit t)


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Searching,  Next: Marking,  Prev: Editor view,  Up: Top

7 Searching
***********

mu4e is fully search-based: even if you 'jump to a folder', you are
executing a query for messages that happen to have the property of
being in a certain folder.

   Normally, queries return up to `mu4e-headers-results-limit' (default:
500) results. That is usually more than enough, and makes things
significantly faster. Sometimes, however, you may want to show _all_
results; you can enable this with `M-x
mu4e-headers-toggle-full-search', or by customizing the variable
`mu4e-headers-full-search'. This applies to all search commands.

   You can also influence the sort order and whether threads are shown
or not; see *note Sort order and threading::.

mu4e queries are the same as the ones that mu find understands(1).

shell's interpretation before mu sees them


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Bookmarks,  Next: Maildir searches,  Prev: Queries,  Up: Searching

7.2 Bookmarks
=============

If you have queries that you use often, you may want to store them as
_bookmarks_. Bookmark searches are available in the main view *note
Main view::, header view *Note Headers view::, and message view *Note
Message view::, using (by default) the key <b> (`M-x
mu4e-search-bookmark'), or <B> (`M-x mu4e-search-bookmark-edit') which
lets you edit the bookmark first.

7.2.1 Setting up bookmarks
--------------------------

mu4e provides a number of default bookmarks. Their definition is
instructive:

     (defvar mu4e-bookmarks
       '( ("flag:unread AND NOT flag:trashed" "Unread messages"      ?u)
          ("date:today..now"                  "Today's messages"     ?t)
          ("date:7d..now"                     "Last 7 days"          ?w)
          ("mime:image/*"                     "Messages with images" ?p))
       "A list of pre-defined queries; these show up in the main
     screen. Each of the list elements is a three-element list of the
     form (QUERY DESCRIPTION KEY), where QUERY is a string with a mu
     query, DESCRIPTION is a short description of the query (this
     shows up in the UI), and KEY is a shortcut key for the query.")

   You can replace these or add your own items, by putting in your
configuration (`~/.emacs') something like:
     (add-to-list 'mu4e-bookmarks
       '("size:5M..500M"       "Big messages"     ?b))

   This prepends your bookmark to the list, and assigns the key <b> to
it. If you want to _append_ your bookmark, you can use `t' as the third
argument to `add-to-list'.

   In the various mu4e views, pressing <b> lists all the bookmarks
defined in the echo area, with the shortcut key highlighted. So, to
invoke the bookmark we just defined (to get the list of "Big
Messages"), all you need to type is `bb'.

7.2.2 Editing bookmarks before searching
----------------------------------------

There is also `M-x mu4e-headers-search-bookmark-edit' (key <B>), which
lets you edit the bookmarked query before invoking it. This can be
useful if you have many similar queries, but need to change some
parameter. For example, you could have a bookmark `"date:today..now AND
"'(1), which limits any result to today's messages.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Not a valid search query by itself


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Maildir searches,  Next: Other search functionality,  Prev: Bookmarks,  Up: Searching

7.3 Maildir searches
====================

Maildir searches are quite similar to bookmark searches (see *note
Bookmarks::), with the difference being that the target is always a
maildir - maildir queries provide a 'traditional' folder-like interface
to a search-based e-mail client. By default, maildir searches are
available in the *note Main view::, *note Headers view::, and *note
Message view::, with the key <j> (`mu4e-jump-to-maildir').

7.3.1 Setting up maildir shortcuts
----------------------------------

You can search for maildirs like can for any other messsage property
(e.g. with a query like maildir:/myfolder), but since it is so common,
mu4e offers a shortcut for this.

   For this to work, you need to set the variable
`mu4e-maildir-shortcuts' to the list of maildirs you want to have quick
access to, for example:

        (setq mu4e-maildir-shortcuts
         '( ("/inbox"     . ?i)
            ("/archive"   . ?a)
            ("/lists"     . ?l)
            ("/work"      . ?w)
            ("/sent"      . ?s))

   This sets <i> as a shortcut for the /inbox folder - effectively a
query maildir:/inbox. There is a special shortcut <o> or </> for
_other_ (so don't use those for your own shortcuts!), which allows you
to choose from _all_ maildirs that you have. There is support for
autocompletion; note that the list of maildirs is determined when mu4e
starts; if there are changes in the maildirs while mu4e is running, you
need to restart mu4e.

   Each of the folder names is relative to your top-level maildir
directory; so if you keep your mail in `~/Maildir', `/inbox' would
refer to `~/Maildir/inbox'. With these shortcuts, you can jump around
your maildirs (folders) very quickly - for example, getting to the
/lists folder only requires you to type `jl', then change to /work with
`jw'.

   The very same shortcuts are used by `M-x mu4e-mark-for-move' (default
shortcut <m>); so, for example, if you want to move a message the
/archive folder, you can do so by typing `ma'.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Other search functionality,  Prev: Maildir searches,  Up: Searching

7.4 Other search functionality
==============================

7.4.1 Navigating through search queries
---------------------------------------

You can navigate through previous/next queries using
`mu4e-headers-query-prev' and `mu4e-headers-query-next', which are
bound to <M-left> and <M-right>, similar to what some web browsers do.

   mu4e tries to be smart and not record duplicate queries. Also, the
number of queries remembered has a fixed limit, so mu4e won't use too
much memory, even if used for a long time. However, if you want to
forget previous/next queries, you can use `M-x
mu4e-headers-forget-queries'.

7.4.2 Narrowing search results
------------------------------

It can be useful to narrow existing search results, that is, to add some
clauses to the current query to match fewer messages.

   For example, suppose you're looking at the some mailing list,
perhaps by jumping to a maildir (`M-x mu4e-headers-jump-to-maildir',
<j>) or because you followed some bookmark (`M-x
mu4e-headers-search-bookmark', <b>). Now, you want to narrow things
down to only those messages that have attachments.  1 This is when `M-x
mu4e-headers-search-narrow' (</>) comes in handy. It asks for an
additional search pattern, which is appended to the current search
query, in effect getting you the subset of the currently shown headers
that also match this extra search pattern. <\> takes you back to the
previous query, so, effectively 'widens' the search. Technically,
narrowing the results of query x with expression y implies doing a
search (x) AND y.

   Note, messages that were not in your in your original search results
because of `mu4e-headers-results-limit', may show up in the narrowed
query.

7.4.3 Including related messages
--------------------------------

It can be useful to not only show the messages that directly match a
certain query, but also include messages that are related to these
messages. That is, messages that belong to the same discussion thread
are included in the results, just like e.g. Gmail does it. You can
enable this behavior by setting `mu4e-headers-include-related' to `t',
and you can toggle between including/not-including with <W>.

7.4.4 Skipping duplicates
-------------------------

Another useful features is skipping duplicate messages. When you have
copies of messages, there's usually little value in including more than
one in search results. A common reason for having multiple copies of
messages in the combination of Gmail and offlineimap, since that is the
way the labels / virtual folders in Gmail are represented. You can
enable skipping duplicates by setting `mu4e-headers-skip-duplicates' to
`t', and you can toggle between the skipping/not skipping with <V>.

   Note, messages are considered duplicates when they have the same
Message-Id.

8 Marking
*********

In mu4e, the common way to do things with messages is a two-step
process - first you _mark_ them for a certain action, then you _execute_
(<x>) those marks. This is similar to the way dired operates. Marking
can happen in both the *note Headers view:: and the *note Message
view::.

File: mu4e.info,  Node: Selecting messages for marking,  Next: What to mark for,  Up: Marking

8.1 Selecting messages for marking
==================================

There are multiple ways to mark messages:
   * _message at point_: you can put a mark on the message-at-point in
     either the *note Headers view:: or *note Message view::

   * _region_: you can put a mark on all messages in the current region
     (selection) in the *note Headers view::

   * _pattern_: you can put a mark on all messages in the *note Headers
     view:: matching a certain pattern with `M-x
     mu4e-headers-mark-pattern' (<%>)

   * _thread/subthread_: You can put a mark on all the messages in the
     thread/subthread at point with `M-x mu4e-headers-mark-thread' and
     `M-x mu4e-headers-mark-subthread', respectively


File: mu4e.info,  Node: What to mark for,  Next: Executing the marks,  Prev: Selecting messages for marking,  Up: Marking

8.2 What to mark for
====================

mu4e supports a number of different marks - i.e., different actions to
apply to messages:

  mark for/as  | keybinding  | description
 --------------+-------------+--------------------------
  'something'  | <insert>    | mark now, decide later
  delete       | D, <delete> | delete
  flag         | +           | mark as 'flagged' (``starred'')
  move         | m           | move to some maildir
  read         | !           | mark as read
  refile       | r           | mark for refiling
  trash        | d           | move to the trash folder
  unflag       | -           | remove 'flagged' mark
  unmark       | u           | remove mark at point
  unmark all   | U           | remove all marks
  unread       | ?           | marks as unread

   After marking a message for something, the left-most columns in the
headers view show some information to indicate what it is marked. This
is informative, but if you mark many (thousands) messages, this slows
things down significantly(1). For this reason, you can disable this by
setting `mu4e-headers-show-target' to `nil'.

   something is a special kind of mark; you can use it to mark messages
for 'something', and then decide later what the 'something' should
be(2)  , using `M-x mu4e-mark-resolve-deferred-marks' (<#>).
Alternatively, mu4e will ask you when you execute the marks (<x>).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) this uses an `emacs' feature called _overlays_, which are slow
when used a lot in a buffer

   (2) This kind of 'deferred marking' is similar to the facility in
midnight commander (`http://www.midnight-commander.org/') and the like,
and uses the same key binding (<insert>).

8.4 Leaving the headers buffer
==============================

When you quit or update a headers buffer that has marked messages (for
example, by doing a new search), mu4e asks you what to do with them,
depending on the value of the variable `mu4e-headers-leave-behavior' -
see its documentation.

8.5 Built-in marking functions
==============================

Some examples of mu4e's built-in marking functions.

   * _Mark the message at point for trashing_: press <d>

   * _Mark all messages in the buffer as unread_: press `C-x h o'

   * _Delete the messages in the current thread_: press `T D'

   * _Mark messages with a subject matching "hello" for flagging_:
     press `% s hello RET'.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Custom mark functions,  Prev: Built-in marking functions,  Up: Marking

8.6 Custom mark functions
=========================

Sometimes, the built-in functions to mark messages may not be
sufficient for your needs. For this, mu4e offers an easy way to define
your own custom mark functions. You can choose one of the custom marker
functions by pressing <&> in the *note Headers view:: and *note Message
view::.

   Custom mark functions are to be appended to the list
`mu4e-headers-custom-markers'. Each of the elements of this list
('markers') is a list with two or three elements:
  1. The name of the marker - a short string describing this marker. The
     first character of this string determines its shortcut, so these
     should be unique. If necessary, simply prefix the name with a
     unique character.

  2. a predicate function, taking two arguments MSG and PARAM.  MSG is
     the message plist (see *note Message functions:: and PARAM is a
     parameter provided by the third of the marker elements (see the
     next item). The predicate function should return non-nil if the
     message matches.

  3. (optionally) a function that is evaluated once, and the result is
     passed as a parameter to the predicate function. This is useful
     when user-input is needed.

   Let's look at an example: suppose we want to match all messages that
have more than _n_ recipients - we could do this with the following
recipe:

     (add-to-list 'mu4e-headers-custom-markers
       '("More than n recipients"
           (lambda (msg n)
             (> (+ (length (mu4e-message-field msg :to))
                   (length (mu4e-message-field msg :cc))) n))
           (lambda ()
             (read-number "Match messages with more recipients than: "))) t)

   After evaluating this expression, you can use it by pressing <&> in
the headers buffer to select a custom marker function, and then <M> to
choose this particular one (M because it is the first character of the
description).

   As you can see, it's not very hard to define simple functions to
match messages. There are more examples in the defaults for
`mu4e-headers-custom-markers'; see `mu4e-headers.el' and see *note
Extending mu4e:: for general information about writing your own
functions.

9 Dynamic folders
*****************

In *note Folders::, we explained how you can set up mu4e's special
folders:
     (setq
       mu4e-sent-folder   "/sent"       ;; sent messages
       mu4e-drafts-folder "/drafts"     ;; unfinished messages
       mu4e-trash-folder  "/trash"      ;; trashed messages
       mu4e-refile-folder "/archive")   ;; saved messages

   In some cases, having such static folders may not suffice - perhaps
you want to change the folders depending on the context. For example,
the folder for refiling could vary, based on the sender of the message.

   To make this possible, instead of setting the standard folders to a
string, you can set them to be a _function_ that takes a message as its
parameter, and returns the desired folder name. This chapter shows you
how to do that. For a more general discussion of how to extend mu4e and
writing your own functions, see *note Extending mu4e::.

* Smart refiling:: Automatically choose the target folder
* Other dynamic folders:: Flexible folders for sent, trash, drafts


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Smart refiling,  Next: Other dynamic folders,  Up: Dynamic folders

9.1 Smart refiling
==================

When refiling messages, perhaps to archive them, it can be useful to
have different target folders for different messages, based on some
property of those message - smart refiling.

   To accomplish this, we can set the refiling folder
(`mu4e-refile-folder') to a function that returns the actual refiling
folder for the particular message. An example should clarify this:

     (setq mu4e-refile-folder
       (lambda (msg)
         (cond
           ;; messages to the mu mailing list go to the /mu folder
           ((mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :to
             "mu-discuss@googlegroups.com")
           	"/mu")
           ;; messages sent directly to me go to /archive
           ;; also `mu4e-user-mail-address-p' can be used
           ((mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :to "me@example.com")
             "/private")
           ;; messages with football or soccer in the subject go to /football
           ((string-match "football\\|soccer"
             (mu4e-message-field msg :subject))
             "/football")
           ;; messages sent by me go to the sent folder
           ((find-if
     	 (lambda (addr)
     	   (mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :from addr))
     	 mu4e-user-mail-address-list)
     	mu4e-sent-folder)
           ;; everything else goes to /archive
           ;; important to have a catch-all at the end!
           (t  "/archive"))))

This can be very powerful; you can select some messages in the headers
view, then press <r>, and have them all marked for refiling to their
particular folders.

   Some notes:
   * We set `mu4e-refile-folder' to an anonymous (lambda) function. This
     function takes one argument, a message plist(1). The plist
     corresponds to the message at point. See *note Message functions::
     for a discussion on how to deal with them.

   * In our function, we use a cond control structure; the function
     returns the first of the clauses that matches. It's important to
     make the last clause a catch-all, so we always return _some_
     folder.

   * We use the convenience function
     `mu4e-message-contact-field-matches', which evaluates to `t' if
     any of the names or e-mail addresses in a contact field (in this
     case, the To:-field) matches the regular expression.

   (1) a property list describing a message


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Other dynamic folders,  Prev: Smart refiling,  Up: Dynamic folders

9.2 Other dynamic folders
=========================

Using the same mechanism, you can create dynamic sent-, trash-, and
drafts-folders. The message-parameter you receive for the sent and
drafts folder is the _original_ message, that is, the message you reply
to, or forward, or edit. If there is no such message (for example when
composing a brand new message) the message parameter is nil.

   Let's look at an example. Suppose you want a different trash folder
for work-email. You can achieve this with something like:

      (setq mu4e-trash-folder
         (lambda (msg)
            ;; the 'and msg' is to handle the case where msg is nil
            (if (and msg
                  (mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :to "me@work.com"))
             "/trash-work"
             "/trash")))

Good to remember:
   * The MSG parameter you receive in the function refers to the
     _original message_, that is, the message being replied to or
     forwarded. When re-editing a message, it refers to the message
     being edited. When you compose a totally new message, the MSG
     parameter is `nil'.

   * When re-editing messages, the value of `mu4e-drafts-folder' is
     ignored.

10 Actions
**********

mu4e lets you define custom actions for messages in the *note Headers
view:: and for both messages and attachments in the *note Message
view::. Custom actions allow you to easily extend mu4e for specific
needs - for example, marking messages as spam in a spam filter or
applying an attachment with a source code patch.

   You can invoke the actions with key <a> for actions on messages, and
key <A> for actions on attachments.

   For general information extending mu4e and writing your own
functions, see *note Extending mu4e::.

* Menu:

* Defining actions::
* Adding an action in the headers view::
* Adding an action in the message view::
* Adding an attachment action::
* More example actions::


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Defining actions,  Next: Adding an action in the headers view,  Up: Actions

10.1 Defining actions
=====================

Defining a new custom action comes down to writing an elisp-function to
do the work. Functions that operate on messages receive a MSG
parameter, which corresponds to the message at point. Something like:
     (defun my-action-func (msg)
      "Describe my message function."
     ;; do stuff
     )

Messages that operate on attachments receive a MSG parameter, which
corresponds to the message at point, and an ATTACHMENT-NUM, which is the
number of the attachment as seen in the message view. An attachment
function looks like:
     (defun my-attachment-action-func (msg attachment-num)
      "Describe my attachment function."
     ;; do stuff
     )

After you have defined your function, you can add it to the list of
actions(1), either `mu4e-headers-actions', `mu4e-view-actions' or
`mu4e-view-attachment-actions'.  The format(2) of each action is a
cons-cell, `(DESCRIPTION . VALUE)'; see below for some examples. If your
shortcut is not also the first character of the description, simply
prefix the description with that character.

   Let's look at some examples.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Instead of defining the functions separately, you can obviously
also add a `lambda'-function directly to the list; however, separate
functions are easier to change

   (2) Note, the format of the actions has changed since version
0.9.8.4, and you must change your configuration to use the new format;
mu4e warns you when you are using the old format.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Adding an action in the headers view,  Next: Adding an action in the message view,  Prev: Defining actions,  Up: Actions

10.2 Adding an action in the headers view
=========================================

Suppose we want to inspect the number of recipients for a message in the
*note Headers view::. We add the following to our configuration:

     (defun show-number-of-recipients (msg)
       "Display the number of recipients for the message at point."
       (message "Number of recipients: %d"
          (+ (length (mu4e-message-field msg :to))
             (length (mu4e-message-field msg :cc)))))

     ;; define 'N' (the first letter of the description) as the shortcut
     ;; the 't' argument to add-to-list puts it at the end of the list
     (add-to-list 'mu4e-headers-actions
        '("Number of recipients" . show-number-of-recipients) t)

   After evaluating this, `a N' in the headers view shows the number of
recipients for the message at point.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Adding an action in the message view,  Next: Adding an attachment action,  Prev: Adding an action in the headers view,  Up: Actions

10.3 Adding an action in the message view
=========================================

As another example, suppose we would like to search for messages by the
sender of the message at point:

     (defun search-for-sender (msg)
       "Search for messages sent by the sender of the message at point."
       (mu4e-headers-search
          (concat "from:" (cdar (mu4e-message-field msg :from)))))

     ;; define 'x' as the shortcut
     (add-to-list 'mu4e-view-actions
        '("xsearch for sender" . search-for-sender) t)

   If you wonder why we use `cdar', remember that the From:-field is a
list of `(NAME . EMAIL)' cells; thus, `cdar' gets us the e-mail address
of the first in the list. From:-fields rarely contain multiple cells.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Adding an attachment action,  Next: More example actions,  Prev: Adding an action in the message view,  Up: Actions

10.4 Adding an attachment action
================================

Finally, let's define an attachment action. As mentioned,
attachment-action functions receive _2_ arguments, the message and the
attachment number to use.

   The following example action counts the number of lines in an
attachment, and defines <n> as its shortcut key (the <n> is prefixed to
the description).

     (defun count-lines-in-attachment (msg attachnum)
       "Count the number of lines in an attachment."
       (mu4e-view-pipe-attachment msg attachnum "wc -l"))

     ;; defining 'n' as the shortcut
     (add-to-list 'mu4e-view-attachment-actions
        '("ncount lines" . count-lines-in-attachment) t)


File: mu4e.info,  Node: More example actions,  Prev: Adding an attachment action,  Up: Actions

10.5 More example actions
=========================

mu4e includes a number of example actions in the file `mu4e-actions.el'
in the source distribution (see `C-h f mu4e-action-TAB'). For example,
for viewing messages in an external web browser, or listening to a
message's body-text using text-to-speech.

11 Extending mu4e
*****************

mu4e is designed to be easily extendible - that is, write your own
emacs-lisp to make mu4e behave exactly as you want. Here, we provide
some guidelines for doing so.

* Menu:

* Extension points::
* Available functions::
* Message functions::
* Utility functions::


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Extension points,  Next: Available functions,  Up: Extending mu4e

11.1 Extension points
=====================

There are a number of places where mu4e lets you plug in your own
functions:
   * Using message-specific folders for drafts, trash, sent messages and
     refiling, based on a function - see *note Dynamic folders::

   * Using an attachment-specific download-directory - see the variable
     `mu4e-attachment-dir'.

   * Apply a function to a message in the headers view - see *note
     Adding an action in the headers view::

   * Apply a function to a message in the message view - see *note
     Adding an action in the message view::

   * Apply a function to to an attachment - see *note Adding an
     attachment action::

   * Custom function to mark certain messages - see *note Custom mark
     functions::

   * Using various _mode_-hooks, `mu4e-compose-pre-hook' (see *note
     Compose hooks::), `mu4e-index-updated-hook' (see *note FAQ::)

You can also write your own functions without using the above. If you
want to do so, key useful functions are `mu4e-message-at-point' (see
below), `mu4e-headers-for-each' (to iterate over all headers, see its
docstring) and `mu4e-view-for-each-part' (to iterate over all
parts/attachments, see its docstring).


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Available functions,  Next: Message functions,  Prev: Extension points,  Up: Extending mu4e

11.2 Available functions
========================

The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the
majority of those are for _internal_ use only; you can recognize them
easily, because they all start with `mu4e~'. These function make all
kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should
therefore _not_ be used. The same is true for _variables_ that start
with `mu4e~'; don't touch them.  Let me repeat that:
    Do not use mu4e~... functions or variables!

In addition, you should use functions in the right context; functions
that start with mu4e-view- are only applicable to the message view,
while functions starting with mu4e-headers- are only applicable to the
headers view. Functions without such prefixes are applicable everywhere.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Message functions,  Next: Utility functions,  Prev: Available functions,  Up: Extending mu4e

11.3 Message functions
======================

Many functions in mu4e deal with message plist (property lists). They
contain information about messages, such as sender and recipient,
subject, date and so on. To deal with these plists, there are a number
of `mu4e-message-' functions (in `mu4e-message.el'), such as
`mu4e-message-field' and `mu4e-message-at-point'

   For example, to get the subject of the message at point, in either
the headers view or the message view, you could write:
     (mu4e-message-field (mu4e-message-at-point) :subject)
   Note that:
   * The contact fields (To, From, Cc, Bcc) are lists of cons-pairs
     `(name . email)'; `name' may be `nil'. So, for example:
          (mu4e-message-field some-msg :to)
          ;; => (("Jack" . "jack@example.com") (nil . "foo@example.com"))
     If you are only looking for a match in this list (e.g., "Is Jack
     one of the recipients of the message?"), there is a convenience
     function `mu4e-message-contact-field-matches' to make this easy.

   * The message body is only available in the message view, not in the
     headers view.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Utility functions,  Prev: Message functions,  Up: Extending mu4e

11.4 Utility functions
======================

`mu4e-utils' contains a number of utility functions; we list a few here;
see their docstrings for the details:
   * `mu4e-read-option': read one option from a list. For example:
           (mu4e-read-option "Choose an animal: "
              '(("Monkey" . monkey) ("Gnu" . gnu) ("xMoose" . moose)))
     The user is presented with:
           Choose an animal: [M]onkey, [G]nu, [x]Moose

   * `mu4e-ask-maildir': ask for a maildir; try one of the shortcuts
     (`mu4e-maildir-shortcuts'), or the full set of available maildirs.

   * `mu4e-running-p': return `t' if the mu4e process is running, `nil'
     otherwise.

   * `(mu4e-user-mail-address-p addr)': return `t' if ADDR is one of
     the user's e-mail addresses (as per `mu4e-user-mail-address-list').

   * `mu4e-log' logs to the mu4e debugging log if it is enabled;
     see `mu4e-toggle-logging'.

   * `mu4e-message', `mu4e-warning', `mu4e-error' are the mu4e
     equivalents of the normal elisp `message', `user-error'(1) and
     `error' functions.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `user-error' only appears in `emacs' 24.2 and later; in older
versions it falls back to `error'

Appendix A Interaction with other tools
***************************************

In this chapter we discuss some ways in ways in which mu4e can cooperate
with other tools.

* Menu:

* Setting the default emacs mail program::
* Creating org-mode links::
* Rich-text messages with org-mode::
* Maintaining an address-book with org-contacts::

* Attaching files with dired::


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Setting the default emacs mail program,  Next: Creating org-mode links,  Up: Interaction with other tools

A.1 Setting the default `emacs' mail program
============================================

`emacs' allows you to select an e-mail program as the default program
it uses when you press <C-x m> (`compose-mail'), call
`report-emacs-bug' and so on. If you want to use mu4e for this, you do
so by adding the following to your configuration:

     (setq mail-user-agent 'mu4e-user-agent)

At the present time, support is experimental.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Creating org-mode links,  Next: Rich-text messages with org-mode,  Prev: Setting the default emacs mail program,  Up: Interaction with other tools

A.2 Creating org-mode links
===========================

It can be useful to include links to e-mail messages or even search
queries in your org-mode files. mu4e supports this with the org-mu4e
module; you can set it up by adding it to your configuration:

     (require 'org-mu4e)

After this, you can use the normal org-mode mechanisms to store links:
`M-x org-store-link' stores a link to a particular message when you're
in *note Message view::, and a link to a query when you are in *note
Headers view::.

   You can insert this link later with `M-x org-insert-link'. From
org-mode, you can go to the query or message the link points to with
either `M-x org-agenda-open-link' in agenda buffers, or `M-x
org-open-at-point' elsewhere - both typically bound to `C-c C-o'.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Rich-text messages with org-mode,  Next: Maintaining an address-book with org-contacts,  Prev: Creating org-mode links,  Up: Interaction with other tools

A.3 Rich-text messages with org-mode
====================================

org-mode has some nice facilities for editing texts - creating lists,
tables, mathematical formulae etc. In addition, it can convert them to
HTML.

   An _experimental_ mu4e feature lets you edit your messages with
org-mode, and (optionally) convert them on the fly (when sending them)
to messages with an HTML-part containing the rich-text version of your
messages.

   To enable this, make sure you have
     (require 'org-mu4e)
   somewhere in your setup, and also make sure that the dvipng program
is available in your path.

   Then, when composing a message, you can use `M-x
org-mu4e-compose-org-mode' to enable this mode.

   `org-mu4e-compose-org-mode' behaves more or less like a minor-mode.
When it is active, editing the message body takes place in org-mode,
while editing the headers uses the normal message editing mode,
`mu4e-compose-mode'.

   If you want to automatically convert the org-mode markup to
rich-text when sending messages, you need to set the variable
`org-mu4e-convert-to-html' to non-nil:

     (setq org-mu4e-convert-to-html t)

To send the message or execute other `mu4e-compose-mode'/`message-mode'
commands on the message, first press <M-m>. Thus, for example, to send
the message, you'd press <M-m C-c>.

   The code for doing the conversion is based on Eric Schultze's
org-mime(1), but has been customized for use with mu4e. In particular,
the mode-switching between `org-mode' and `mu4e-compose-mode' is
mu4e-specific.

A.3.1 Some caveats
------------------

It is better _not_ to put org-mu4e-compose-org-mode in a mode-hook for
mu4e-compose-mode, since that makes it impossible to shut it off again
for the particular message(2).

   In addition, currently the rich-text code does not work well with the
MIME-functionality, such as adding attachments or signing/encrypting
messages. If you need any of that, it's better to use plain-text
messages.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-mime.php'

   (2) This is because mu4e-compose-mode in invoked again internally
when switching, which re-triggers the hook-function.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Maintaining an address-book with org-contacts,  Next: Getting new mail notifications with Sauron,  Prev: Rich-text messages with org-mode,  Up: Interaction with other tools

A.4 Maintaining an address-book with org-contacts
=================================================

Note, mu4e supports built-in address autocompletion; *note Address
autocompletion::, and that is the recommended way to do this. However,
it is also possible to manage your addresses with org-mode, using
org-contacts(1).

   mu4e-actions defines a useful action (*note Actions::) for adding a
contact based on the From:-address in the message at point. To enable
this, add to your configuration something like:

     (setq mu4e-org-contacts-file  <full-path-to-your-org-contacts-file>)
     (add-to-list 'mu4e-headers-actions
       '("org-contact-add" . mu4e-action-add-org-contact) t)
     (add-to-list 'mu4e-view-actions
       '("org-contact-add" . mu4e-action-add-org-contact) t)

After this, you should be able to add contacts using <a o> in the
headers view and the message view, using the org-capture mechanism.
Note, the shortcut character <o> is due to the first character of
org-contact-add.

A.5 Getting new mail notifications with Sauron
==============================================

The `emacs'-package sauron(1) (by the same author) can be used to get
notifications about new mails. If you put something like the below
script in your crontab (or have some other way of having it execute
every _n_ minutes) you receive notifications in the sauron-buffer when
new messages arrive.

#!/bin/sh
# put the path to your Inbox folder here

CHECKDIR="/home/$LOGNAME/Maildir/Inbox"
sauron-msg () {
    DBUS_COOKIE="/home/$LOGNAME/.sauron-dbus"
    if test "x$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" = "x"; then
        if test -e $DBUS_COOKIE; then
                export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="`cat $DBUS_COOKIE`"
        fi
    fi
    if test -n "x$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"; then
        dbus-send --session                          \
            --dest="org.gnu.Emacs"                   \
            --type=method_call                       \
            "/org/gnu/Emacs/Sauron"                  \
            "org.gnu.Emacs.Sauron.AddMsgEvent"       \
            string:shell uint32:3 string:"$1"
    fi
}

     (setq sauron-dbus-cookie t)
   in your setup, to allow the script to find the D-Bus session bus,
even when running outside its session.

A.6 Speedbar support
====================

`speedbar' is an `emacs'-extension that shows navigational information
for an `emacs' buffer in a separate frame. Using `mu4e-speedbar', mu4e
lists your bookmarks and maildir folders and allows for one-click
access to them.

   mu4e loads mu4e-speedbar automatically; all you need to do to
activate it is `M-x speedbar'. Then, when then switching to the *note
Main view::, the speedbar-frame is updated with your bookmarks and
maildirs. For speed reasons, the list of maildirs is determined when
mu4e starts; if the list of maildirs changes while mu4e is running, you
need to restart mu4e to have those changes reflected in the speedbar
and in other places that use this list, such as auto-completion when
jumping to a maildir.

   `mu4e-speedbar' was contributed by _Antono Vasiljev_.

A.7 Citations with mu-cite
==========================

mu-cite(1) is a package to control the way message citations look like
(i.e., the message you responded to when you reply to them or forward
them), with its latest version available at
`http://www.jpl.org/elips/mu/'.

   After installing mu-cite, you can use something like the following
to make it work with mu4e:

     (require 'mu-cite)
     (setq message-cite-function 'mu-cite-original)
     (setq mu-cite-top-format
         '("On " date ", " from " wrote:\n\n"))
     (setq mu-cite-prefix-format '(" > ")))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note, despite its name, mu-cite is a project unconnected to
mu/mu4e


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Attaching files with dired,  Prev: Citations with mu-cite,  Up: Interaction with other tools

A.8 Attaching files with dired
==============================

It is possible to attach files to mu4e messages using dired (*note
(emacs)Dired::), using the following steps (based on a post on the
mu-discuss mailing list by _Stephen Eglen_).

   To prepare for this, you need a special version of the
`gnus-dired-mail-buffers' function so it understands mu4e buffers as
well; so put in your configuration:

     (require 'gnus-dired)
     ;; make the `gnus-dired-mail-buffers' function also work on
     ;; message-mode derived modes, such as mu4e-compose-mode
     (defun gnus-dired-mail-buffers ()
       "Return a list of active message buffers."
       (let (buffers)
         (save-current-buffer
           (dolist (buffer (buffer-list t))
     	(set-buffer buffer)
     	(when (and (derived-mode-p 'message-mode)
     		(null message-sent-message-via))
     	  (push (buffer-name buffer) buffers))))
         (nreverse buffers)))

     (setq gnus-dired-mail-mode 'mu4e-user-agent)
     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'turn-on-gnus-dired-mode)

   Then, mark the file(s) in dired you would like to attach and press
C-c RET C-a, and you'll be asked whether to attach them to an existing
message, or create a new one.

Appendix B Example configurations
*********************************

In this chapter, we show some example configurations. While it is very
useful to see some working settings, we'd like to warn against blindly
copying such things.

B.1 Minimal configuration
=========================

An (almost) minimal configuration for mu4e might look like this - as you
see most is commented-out.

     ;; example configuration for mu4e

     ;; make sure mu4e is in your load-path
     (require 'mu4e)

     ;; Only needed if your maildir is _not_ ~/Maildir
     ;;(setq mu4e-maildir "/home/user/Maildir")

     ;; these must start with a "/", and must exist
     ;; (i.e.. /home/user/Maildir/sent must exist)
     ;; you use e.g. 'mu mkdir' to make the Maildirs if they don't
     ;; already exist

     ;; below are the defaults; if they do not exist yet, mu4e offers to
     ;; create them. they can also functions; see their docstrings.
     ;; (setq mu4e-sent-folder   "/sent")
     ;; (setq mu4e-drafts-folder "/drafts")
     ;; (setq mu4e-trash-folder  "/trash")

     ;; smtp mail setting; these are the same that `gnus' uses.

A somewhat longer configuration, showing some more things that you can
customize.

     ;; example configuration for mu4e
     (require 'mu4e)

     ;; path to our Maildir directory
     (setq mu4e-maildir "/home/user/Maildir")

File: mu4e.info,  Node: Gmail configuration,  Next: Some other useful settings,  Prev: Longer configuration,  Up: Example configurations

B.3 Gmail configuration
=======================

_Gmail_ is a popular e-mail provider; let's see how we can make it work
with mu4e. Since we are using IMAP, you must enable that in the Gmail
web interface (in the settings, under the "Forwarding and
POP/IMAP"-tab).

   Gmail users may also be interested in *note skipping duplicates:
Including related messages.

B.3.1 Setting up offlineimap
----------------------------

First of all, we need a program to get the e-mail from Gmail to our
local machine; for this we use offlineimap; on Debian (and derivatives
like Ubuntu), this is as easy as:

$ sudo apt-get install offlineimap

   while on Fedora (and similar) you need:
$ sudo yum install offlineimap

   Then, we can configure offlineimap by editing `~/.offlineimaprc':

[general]
accounts = Gmail
maxsyncaccounts = 3

[Account Gmail]
localrepository = Local
remoterepository = Remote

[Repository Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/Maildir

[Repository Remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = imap.gmail.com
remoteuser = USERNAME@gmail.com
remotepass = PASSWORD
ssl = yes
maxconnections = 1
realdelete = no

   Obviously, you need to replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with your actual
Gmail username and password. After this, you should be able to download
your mail:

$ offlineimap
 OfflineIMAP 6.3.4
Copyright 2002-2011 John Goerzen & contributors.
Licensed under the GNU GPL v2+ (v2 or any later version).

Account sync Gmail:
 ***** Processing account Gmail
 Copying folder structure from IMAP to Maildir
 Establishing connection to imap.gmail.com:993.
Folder sync [Gmail]:
 Syncing INBOX: IMAP -> Maildir
 Syncing [Gmail]/All Mail: IMAP -> Maildir
 Syncing [Gmail]/Drafts: IMAP -> Maildir
 Syncing [Gmail]/Sent Mail: IMAP -> Maildir
 Syncing [Gmail]/Spam: IMAP -> Maildir
 Syncing [Gmail]/Starred: IMAP -> Maildir
 Syncing [Gmail]/Trash: IMAP -> Maildir
Account sync Gmail:
 ***** Finished processing account Gmail

   We can now run `mu' to make sure things work:

$ mu index
mu: indexing messages under /home/foo/Maildir [/home/foo/.mu/xapian]
| processing mail; processed: 520; updated/new: 520, cleaned-up: 0
mu: elapsed: 3 second(s), ~ 173 msg/s
mu: cleaning up messages [/home/foo/.mu/xapian]
/ processing mail; processed: 520; updated/new: 0, cleaned-up: 0
mu: elapsed: 0 second(s)

   We can run both the offlineimap and the mu index from within mu4e,
but running it from the command line makes it a bit easier to
troubleshoot as we are setting things up.

B.3.2 Settings
--------------

Next step: let's make a mu4e configuration for this:

     (require 'mu4e)

     ;; default
     ;; (setq mu4e-maildir "~/Maildir")

     (setq mu4e-drafts-folder "/[Gmail].Drafts")
     (setq mu4e-sent-folder   "/[Gmail].Sent Mail")
     (setq mu4e-trash-folder  "/[Gmail].Trash")

     ;; don't save message to Sent Messages, Gmail/IMAP takes care of this
     (setq mu4e-sent-messages-behavior 'delete)

     ;; setup some handy shortcuts
     ;; you can quickly switch to your Inbox -- press ``ji''
     ;; then, when you want archive some messages, move them to
     ;; the 'All Mail' folder by pressing ``ma''.

     (setq mu4e-maildir-shortcuts
         '( ("/INBOX"               . ?i)
            ("/[Gmail].Sent Mail"   . ?s)
            ("/[Gmail].Trash"       . ?t)
            ("/[Gmail].All Mail"    . ?a)))

     ;; allow for updating mail using 'U' in the main view:
     (setq mu4e-get-mail-command "offlineimap")

     ;; something about ourselves
     (setq
        user-mail-address "USERNAME@gmail.com"
        user-full-name  "Foo X. Bar"
        message-signature
         (concat
           "Foo X. Bar\n"
           "http://www.example.com\n"))

     ;; sending mail -- replace USERNAME with your gmail username
     ;; also, make sure the gnutls command line utils are installed
     ;; package 'gnutls-bin' in Debian/Ubuntu

     (require 'smtpmail)
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
        starttls-use-gnutls t
        smtpmail-starttls-credentials '(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 nil nil))
        smtpmail-auth-credentials
          '(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 "USERNAME@gmail.com" nil))
        smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
        smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
        smtpmail-smtp-service 587)

     ;; alternatively, for emacs-24 you can use:
     ;;(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
     ;;     smtpmail-stream-type 'starttls
     ;;     smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
     ;;     smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
     ;;     smtpmail-smtp-service 587)

     ;; don't keep message buffers around
     (setq message-kill-buffer-on-exit t)

   And that's it - put the above in your `~/.emacs', change USERNAME
etc. to your own, and restart `emacs', and run `M-x mu4e'.

B.4 Some other useful settings
==============================

Finally, here are some more settings that are useful, but not enabled by
default for various reasons.

     ;; use 'fancy' non-ascii characters in various places in mu4e
     (setq mu4e-use-fancy-chars t)

     ;; save attachment to my desktop (this can also be a function)
     (setq mu4e-attachment-dir "~/Desktop")

     ;; attempt to show images when viewing messages
     (setq
       mu4e-view-show-images t
       mu4e-view-image-max-width 800)

Appendix C FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
*******************************************

In this chapter we list a number of actual and anticipated questions
and their answers.

* Menu:

* General::
* Reading messages::
* Writing messages::
* Known issues::


File: mu4e.info,  Node: General,  Next: Reading messages,  Up: FAQ

C.1 General
===========

  1. _How can I quickly delete/move/trash a lot of messages?_ You can
     select ('mark' in `emacs'-speak) the messages like you would select
     text in a buffer; the actions you then take (e.g., <DEL> for
     delete, <m> for move and <t> for trash) apply to all selected
     messages. You can also use functions like
     `mu4e-headers-mark-thread' (<T>), `mu4e-headers-mark-subthread'
     (<t>) to mark whole threads at the same time, and
     `mu4e-headers-mark-pattern' (<%>) to mark all messages matching a
     certain regular expression.

  2. _mu4e seems to return a subset of all matches - how can I get
     all?_ For speed reasons, mu4e returns only up to the value of the
     variable `m4ue-search-result-limit' (default: 500) matches. To
     show _all_, use `M-x mu4e-headers-toggle-full-search' (<Q>), or
     customize the variable `mu4e-headers-full-search'. This applies to
     all search commands.

  3. _How can I get notifications when receiving mail?_ There is
     `mu4e-index-updated-hook', which gets triggered when the indexing
     process triggered sees an update (not just new mail though). To
     use this hook, put something like the following in your setup
     (assuming you have aplay and some soundfile, change as needed):
          (add-hook 'mu4e-index-updated-hook
            (defun new-mail-sound ()
              (shell-command "aplay ~/Sounds/boing.wav&")))

  4. _It seems my headers-buffer is automatically updated when new
     messages are found during the indexing process - can I disable this
      somehow?_ Yes - set `mu4e-headers-auto-update' to `nil'.

  5. _I don't use offlineimap, fetchmail etc., I get my mail through my
     own mailserver. What should I use for `mu4e-get-mail-command'_?
     Use "true" (or don't do anything, it's the default). This makes
     getting mail a no-op, but the messages are still re-indexed.

  6. _How can I re-index my messages without getting new mail?_ Use
     `M-x mu4e-update-index'

  7. _When I try to run mu index while mu4e is running I get errors
     like:_ mu: mu_store_new_writable: xapian error
       'Unable to get write lock on ~/.mu/xapian: already locked
      _What to do about this?_  You get this error because the
     underlying Xapian database is locked by some other process; it can
     be opened only once in read-write mode. There is not much mu4e can
     do about this, but if is another `mu' instance that is holding the
     lock, you can ask it to (gracefully) terminate:    pkill -2 -u $UID mu # send SIGINT
        sleep 1
        mu index
      mu4e automatically restarts mu when it needs it. In practice, this
     seems to work quite well.

  8. _Can I automatically apply the marks on messages when leaving the
     headers buffer?_ Yes you can - see the documentation for the
     variable mu4e-headers-leave-behavior.

  9. _Is there context-sensitive help available?_ Yes - pressing <H>
     should take you to the right place in this manual.

 10. _How can I set mu4e as the default e-mail client in `emacs'?_ See
     *note Setting the default emacs mail program::.

 11. _Can mu4e use some fancy Unicode characters instead of these
     boring plain-ASCII ones?_ Glad you asked! Yes, if you set
     `mu4e-use-fancy-chars' to t, mu4e uses such fancy characters in a
     number of places.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Reading messages,  Next: Writing messages,  Prev: General,  Up: FAQ

C.2 Reading messages
====================

  1. _How can I show attached images in my message view buffers?_ See
     *note Viewing images inline::.

  2. _How can I word-wrap long lines in when viewing a message?_ You
     can toggle between wrapped and non-wrapped states using <w>. If
     you want to do this automatically, invoke `longlines-mode' in your
     `mu4e-view-mode-hook'.

  3. _What about hiding cited parts?_ Toggle between hiding and showing
     of cited parts with <h>. If you want to hide parts automatically,
     call `mu4e-view-toggle-hide-cited' in your `mu4e-view-mode-hook'.

  4. _How can I perform custom actions on messages and attachments?_ See
     *note Actions::.

  5. _Does mu4e support crypto (i.e., decrypting messages and verifying
     signatures)?_  Yes - if mu was built with GMime 2.6 or later, it
     is possible to do both (note, only PGP/MIME is supported). In the
     *note Main view:: the support is indicated by a big letter C on
     the right hand side of the mu4e version. See *note Decryption::
     and *note Verifying signatures::. For encryption and signing
     messages, see the *note Writing messages::.

  6. _Does mu4e support including all related messages in a thread,
     like Gmail does?_ Yes - see *note Including related messages::.

  7. _There seem to be a lot of duplicate messages - how can I get rid
     of them?_ See *note Skipping duplicates::.

  8. _Some messages are almost unreadable in emacs - can I view them in
     an external web browser?_ Indeed, airlines often send messages
     that heavily depend on html and are hard to digest inside emacs.
     Fortunately, there's an _action_ (*note Adding an action in the
     message view::) defined for this. Simply add to your configuration:
          (add-to-list 'mu4e-view-actions
            '("ViewInBrowser" . mu4e-action-view-in-browser) t)
     Now, when viewing such a difficult message, type `aV', and the
     message opens inside a webbrowser. You can influence the browser
     with `browse-url-generic-program'.

C.3 Writing messages
====================

  1. _How can I automatically set the From:-address for a
     reply-message, based on some field in the original?_ See *note
     Compose hooks::.

  2. _And what about customizable folders for draft messages, sent
     messages, trashed messages, based on e.g. the From: header?_ See
     *note Dynamic folders::.

  3. _How can I automatically add some header to an outgoing message?_
     Once more, see *note Compose hooks::.

  4. _How can I influence the way the original message looks when
     replying or forwarding?_ Since `mu4e-compose-mode' derives from
     `message-mode', you can re-use many of the latter's facilities.
     *note (message)Insertion Variables::.

  5. _How can I easily include attachments in the messages I write?_
     You can drag-and-drop from your desktop; alternatively, you can
     use dired - see *note Attaching files with dired::.

  6. _mu4e seems to remove myself from the Cc:-list; how can I prevent
     that?_  Set `mu4e-compose-keep-self-cc' to t in your configuration.

  7. _How can I sign or encrypt messages?_ You can do so using `emacs''
     MIME-support - check the Attachments-menu while composing a
     message. Also see *note Signing and encrypting::.

  8. _Can I use BBDB with mu4e?_ It should be possible, but there is no
     built-in support. Instead, we recommend using mu4e's *note Address
     autocompletion::.

  9. _After sending some messages, it seems the buffer for these
     messages stay around. How can I get rid of those?_
          (setq message-kill-buffer-on-exit t)

 10. _Sending big messages is slow and blocks emacs - what can I do
     about it?_ For this, there's
     `https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async' (also available from the
     Emacs package repository); add the following snippet to your
     configuration:
          (require 'smtpmail-async)
          (setq
            send-mail-function 'async-smtpmail-send-it
            message-send-mail-function 'async-smtpmail-send-it)
     With this, messages are sent using background emacs-instance.

C.4 Known issues
================

Although they are not really _questions_, we end this chapter with a
list of known issue and/or missing features in mu4e. Thus, users won't
have to search in vain for things that are not there (yet), and the
author can use it as a todo-list.

   * _mu4e does not work well if the `emacs' language environment is not
     utf-8_; so, if you problems with encodings, be sure to have
     `(set-language-environment "UTF-8")' in your `~/.emacs'.

   * _Thread handling is incomplete._ While threads are calculated and
     are visible in the headers buffer, you can not collapse/open them.

   * _The key-bindings are _somewhat_ hard-coded._ That is, the main
     menu assumes the default key-bindings, as do the
     clicks-on-bookmarks.

D.1 Multiple accounts
=====================

Using mu4e with multiple email accounts is fairly easy. Although
variables such as `user-mail-address', `mu4e-sent-folder', `message-*',
`smtpmail-*', etc. typically only take one value, it is easy to change
their values using `mu4e-compose-pre-hook'.  The setup described here
is one way of doing this (though certainly not the only way).

   This setup assumes that you have multiple mail accounts under
`mu4e-maildir'. As an example, we'll use ~/Maildir/Account1 and
~/Maildir/Account2, but the setup works just as well if `mu4e-maildir'
points to something else.

   First, you need to make sure that all variables that you wish to
change based on user account are set to some initial value. So set up
your environment with e.g., your main account:

     (setq mu4e-sent-folder "/Account1/Saved Items"
           mu4e-drafts-folder "/Account1/Drafts"
           user-mail-address "my.address@account1.tld"
           message-signature-file ".Signature1.txt"
           smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.account1.tld"
           smtpmail-local-domain "account1.tld"
           smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.account1.tld"
           smtpmail-stream-type starttls
           smtpmail-smtp-service 25)

   Then create a variable `my-mu4e-account-alist', which should contain
a list for each of your accounts. Each list should start with the
account name, (which _must_ be identical to the account's directory
name under ~/Maildir), followed by `(variable value)' pairs:

     (defvar my-mu4e-account-alist
       '(("Account1"
          (mu4e-sent-folder "/Account1/Saved Items")
          (mu4e-drafts-folder "/Account1/Drafts")
          (user-mail-address "my.address@account1.tld")
          (message-signature-file ".Signature1.txt")
          (smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.account1.tld")
          (smtpmail-local-domain "account1.tld")
          (smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.account1.tld")
          (smtpmail-stream-type starttls)
          (smtpmail-smtp-service 25))
         ("Account2"
          (mu4e-sent-folder "/Account2/Saved Items")
          (mu4e-drafts-folder "/Account2/Drafts")
          (user-mail-address "my.address@account2.tld)
          (message-signature-file ".Signature2.txt")
          (smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.account2.tld)
          (smtpmail-local-domain "account2.tld")
          (smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.account2.tld)
          (smtpmail-stream-type starttls)
          (smtpmail-smtp-service 587))))

   You can put any variables you want in the account lists, just make
sure that you put in _all_ the variables that differ for each account.
Variables that do not differ do not be included. For example, if you use
the same smtp server for both accounts, you don't need to include the
smtp-related variables in `my-mu4e-account-alist'.

   Now, the following function can be used to select an account and set
the variables in `my-mu4e-account-alist' to the correct values:

     (defun my-mu4e-set-account ()
       "Set the account for composing a message."
       (let* ((account
               (if mu4e-compose-parent-message
                   (let ((maildir (mu4e-message-field mu4e-compose-parent-message :maildir)))
                     (string-match "/\\(.*?\\)/" maildir)
                     (match-string 1 maildir))
                 (completing-read (format "Compose with account: (%s) "
                                          (mapconcat #'(lambda (var) (car var)) my-mu4e-account-alist "/"))
                                  (mapcar #'(lambda (var) (car var)) my-mu4e-account-alist)
                                  nil t nil nil (caar my-mu4e-account-alist))))
              (account-vars (cdr (assoc account my-mu4e-account-alist))))
         (if account-vars
             (mapc #'(lambda (var)
                       (set (car var) (cadr var)))
                   account-vars)
           (error "No email account found"))))

   This function then needs to be added to `mu4e-compose-pre-hook':

     (add-hook 'mu4e-compose-pre-hook 'my-mu4e-set-account)

   This way, `my-mu4e-set-account' will be called every time you edit a
message. If you compose a new message, it simply asks you for the
account you wish to send the message from (TAB completion works). If
you're replying or forwarding a message, or editing an existing draft,
the account is chosen automatically, based on the first component of the
maildir of the message being replied to, forwarded or edited (i.e., the
directory under ~/Maildir).


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Refiling message,  Next: Saving outgoing messages,  Prev: Multiple accounts,  Up: Tips and Tricks

D.2 Refiling message
====================

By setting `mu4e-refile-folder' to a function, you can dynamically
determine where messages are to be refiled. If you want to do this based
on the subject of a message, you can use a function that matches the
subject against a list of regexes in the following way. First, set up a
variable `my-mu4e-subject-alist' containing regexes plus associated
mail folders:

     (defvar my-mu4e-subject-alist '(("kolloqui\\(um\\|a\\)" . "/Kolloquium")
                                     ("Calls" . "/Calls")
                                     ("Lehr" . "/Lehre")
                                     ("webseite\\|homepage\\|website" . "/Webseite"))
       "List of subjects and their respective refile folders.")

   Now you can use the following function to automatically refile
messages based on their subject line:

     (defun my-mu4e-refile-folder-function (msg)
       "Set the refile folder for MSG."
       (let ((subject (mu4e-message-field msg :subject))
             (folder (or (cdar (member* subject my-mu4e-subject-alist
                                        :test #'(lambda (x y)
                                                  (string-match (car y) x))))
                         "/General")))
         folder))

   Note the "/General" folder: it is the default folder in case the
subject does not match any of the regexes in `my-mu4e-subject-alist'.

   In order to make this work, you'll of course need to set
`mu4e-refile-folder' to this function:

     (setq mu4e-refile-folder 'my-mu4e-refile-folder-function)

   If you have multiple accounts, you can accommodate them as well:

     (defun my-mu4e-refile-folder-function (msg)
       "Set the refile folder for MSG."
       (let ((maildir (mu4e-message-field msg :maildir))
             (subject (mu4e-message-field msg :subject))
             folder)
         (cond
          ((string-match "Account1" maildir)
           (setq folder (or (catch 'found
                              (dolist (mailing-list my-mu4e-mailing-lists)
                                (if (mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :to (car mailing-list))
                                    (throw 'found (cdr mailing-list)))))
                            "/Account1/General")))
          ((string-match "Gmail" maildir)
           (setq folder "/Gmail/All Mail"))
          ((string-match "Account2" maildir)
           (setq folder (or (cdar (member* subject my-mu4e-subject-alist
                                           :test #'(lambda (x y)
                                                     (string-match (car y) x))))
                            "/Account2/General"))))
         folder))

   This function actually uses different methods to determine the refile
folder, depending on the account: For Account2, it uses
`my-mu4e-subject-alist', for the Gmail account it simply uses the
folder "All Mail". For Account1, it uses another method: it files the
message based on the mailing list to which it was sent. This requires
another variable:

     (defvar my-mu4e-mailing-lists '(("mu-discuss@googlegroups.com" . "/Account1/mu4e")
                                     ("pandoc-discuss@googlegroups.com" . "/Account1/Pandoc")
                                     ("auctex@gnu.org" . "/Account1/AUCTeX"))
       "List of mailing list addresses and folders where their messages are saved.")

D.3 Saving outgoing messages
============================

Like `mu4e-refile-folder', the variable `mu4e-sent-folder' can also be
set to a function, in order to dynamically determine the save folder.
One might, for example, wish to automatically put messages going to
mailing lists into the trash (because you'll receive them back from the
list). If you have set up the variable `my-mu4e-mailing-lists' as
above, you can use the following function to determine a save folder:

     (defun my-mu4e-sent-folder-function (msg)
       "Set the sent folder for the current message."
       (let ((from-address (message-field-value "From"))
             (to-address (message-field-value "To")))
         (cond
          ((string-match "my.address@account1.tld" from-address)
           (if (member* to-address my-mu4e-mailing-lists
                        :test #'(lambda (x y)
                                  (string-match (car y) x)))
               "/Trash"
             "/Account1/Sent"))
          ((string-match "my.address@gmail.com" from-address)
           "/Gmail/Sent Mail")
          (t (mu4e-ask-maildir-check-exists "Save message to maildir: ")))))

   Note that this function doesn't use `(mu4e-message-field msg
:maildir)' to determine which account the message is being sent from.
The reason is that that the function in `mu4e-sent-folder' is called
when you send the message, but before mu4e has created the message
struct from the compose buffer, so that `mu4e-message-field' cannot be
used. Instead, the function uses `message-field-value', which extracts
the values of the headers in the compose buffer. This means that it is
not possible to extract the account name from the message's maildir, so
instead the from address is used to determine the account.

   Again, the function shows three different possibilities: for the
first account (my.address@account1.tld) it uses `my-mu4e-mailing-lists'
again to determine if the message goes to a mailing list. If so, the
message is put in the trash folder, if not, it is saved in
/Account1/Sent. For the second (Gmail) account, sent mail is simply
saved in the Sent Mail folder.

   If the from address is not associated with Account1 or with the Gmail
account, the function uses `mu4e-ask-maildir-check-exists' to ask the
user for a maildir to save the message in.

File: mu4e.info,  Node: High-level overview,  Next: mu server,  Up: How it works

E.1 High-level overview
=======================

At a high level, we can summarize the structure of the mu4e system using
some ascii-art:

                   +---------+
                   | emacs   |
                   |    +------+
                   +----| mu4e | --> send mail (smtpmail)
                        +------+
                         |  A
                         V  |  ---/ search, view, move mail
                   +---------+    \
                   |   mu    |
                   +---------+
                     |    A
                     V    |
                   +---------+
                   | Maildir |  <--- receive mail (fetchmail,
                   +---------+                     offlineimap, ...)

   In words:
   * Your e-mail messages are stored in a Maildir-directory (typically,
     `~/Maildir' and its subdirectories), and new mail comes in using
     tools like fetchmail, offlineimap, or through a local mail server.

   * mu indexes these messages periodically, so you can quickly search
     for them. mu can run in a special server-mode, where it provides
     services  to client software.

   * mu4e, which runs inside `emacs' is  such a client; it communicates
     with `mu' (in its server-mode to search  for messages, and
     manipulate them.

   * mu4e uses the facilities  offered by `emacs' (the Gnus message
     editor and smtpmail) to send  messages.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: mu server,  Next: Reading from the server,  Prev: High-level overview,  Up: How it works

E.2 mu server
=============

mu4e is based on the mu e-mail searching/indexer. The latter is a
C-program; there are different ways to communicate with a client that is
emacs-based.

   One way to implement this, would be to call the mu command-line tool
with some parameters and then parse the output. In fact, that was the
first approach - mu4e would invoke e.g., mu find and process the output
in `emacs'.

   However, with this approach, we need to load the entire e-mail
_Xapian_ database (in which the message is stored) for each invocation.
Wouldn't it be nicer to keep a running mu instance around?  Indeed, it
would - and thus, the mu server sub-command was born. Running mu server
starts a simple shell, in which you can give commands to `mu', which
then spits out the results/errors. `mu server' is not meant for humans,
but it can be used manually, which is great for debugging.


File: mu4e.info,  Node: Reading from the server,  Next: The message s-expression,  Prev: mu server,  Up: How it works

E.3 Reading from the server
===========================

In the design, the next question was what format mu should use for its
output for mu4e (`emacs') to process. Some other programs use JSON
here, but it seemed easier (and possibly, more efficient) just to talk
to `emacs' in its native language: _s-expressions_, and interpret those
using the `emacs'-function `read-from-string'. See *note The message
s-expression:: for details on the format.

   So, now let's look how we process the data from mu server in
`emacs'. We'll leave out a lot of detail, mu4e-specifics, and look at a
bit more generic approach.

   The first thing to do is to create a process (for example, with
`start-process'), and then register a filter function for it, which is
invoked whenever the process has some data for us. Something like:

       (let ((proc (start-process <arguments>)))
         (set-process-filter proc 'my-process-filter)
         (set-process-sentinel proc 'my-process-sentinel))

   Note, the process sentinel is invoked when the process is terminated
- so there you can clean things up. The function `my-process-filter' is
a user-defined function that takes the process and the chunk of output
as arguments; in mu4e it looks something like (pseudo-lisp):

     (defun my-process-filter (proc str)
       ;; mu4e-buf: a global string variable to which data gets appended
       ;; as we receive it
       (setq mu4e-buf (concat mu4e-buf str))
       (when <we-have-received-a-full-expression>
           <eat-expression-from mu4e-buf>
           <evaluate-expression>))

   `<evaluate-expression>' de-multiplexes the s-expression we got. For
example, if the s-expression looks like an e-mail message header, it is
processed by the header-handling function, which appends it to the
header list. If the s-expression looks like an error message, it is
reported to the user. And so on.

   The language between frontend and backend is documented in the
mu-server man-page. mu4e can log these communications; you can use `M-x
mu4e-toggle-logging' to turn logging on and off, and you can view the
log using `M-x mu4e-show-log' (<$>).


File: mu4e.info,  Node: The message s-expression,  Prev: Reading from the server,  Up: How it works

E.4 The message s-expression
============================

A typical message s-expression looks something like the following:

     (:docid 32461
      :from (("Nikola Tesla" . "niko@example.com"))
      :to (("Thomas Edison" . "tom@example.com"))
      :cc (("Rupert The Monkey" . "rupert@example.com"))
      :subject "RE: what about the 50K?"
      :date (20369 17624 0)
      :size 4337
      :message-id "C8233AB82D81EE81AF0114E4E74@123213.mail.example.com"
      :path  "/home/tom/Maildir/INBOX/cur/133443243973_1.10027.atlas:2,S"
      :maildir "/INBOX"
      :priority normal
      :flags (seen)
      :parts ( (:index 1 :mime-type "text/plain" :size 12345 :attachment nil)
               (:index 2 :name "photo.jpg" :mime-type "image/jpeg"
                :size 147331 :attachment t)
               (:index 3 :name "book.pdf" :mime-type "application/pdf"
                :size 192220 :attachment t))
      :references  ("C8384574032D81EE81AF0114E4E74@123213.mail.example.com"
      "38203498230942D81EE81AF0114E4E74@123213.mail.example.com")
      :in-reply-to "38203498230942D81EE81AF0114E4E74@123213.mail.example.com"
      :body-txt "Hi Tom,
      ....
     "))

   This s-expression forms a property list (plist), and we can get
values from it using plist-get; for example `(plist-get msg :subject)'
would get you the message subject. However, it's better to use the
function `mu4e-message-field' to shield you from some of the
implementation details that are subject to change; and see the other
convenience functions in `mu4e-message.el'.

   Some notes on the format:
   * The address fields are _lists_ of pairs `(name . email)', where
     name can be nil.

   * The date is in format `emacs' uses (for example in
     `current-time').(1)

   * Attachments are a list of elements with fields :index (the number
     of the MIME-part), :name (the file name, if any), :mime-type (the
     MIME-type, if any) and :size (the size in bytes, if any).

   * Messages in the *note Headers view:: come from the database and do
     not have :attachments. :body-txt or :body-html fields. Message in
     the *note Message view:: use the actual message file, and do
     include these fields.

E.4.1 Example: ping-pong
------------------------

As an example of the communication between mu4e and `mu', let's look at
the ping-pong-sequence. When mu4e starts, it sends a command ping to
the the mu server backend, to learn about its version. mu server then
responds with a pong s-expression to provide this information (this is
implemented in `mu-cmd-server.c').

   We start this sequence when mu4e is invoked (when the program is
started). It calls mu4e-proc-ping, and registers a (lambda) function for
mu4e-proc-pong-func, to handle the response.

-> ping
<- (pong "mu" :version "x.x.x" :doccount 10000)

   When we receive such a pong (in `mu4e-proc.el'), the lambda function
we registered is called, and it compares the version we got from the
pong with the version we expected, and raises an error, if they differ.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Emacs 32-bit integers have only 29 bits available for the actual
number; the other bits are use by `emacs' for internal purposes.
Therefore, we need to split time_t in two numbers.

Appendix F Logging and debugging
********************************

As explained in *note How it works::, mu4e communicates with its backend
(mu server) by sending commands and receiving responses (s-expressions).

   For debugging purposes, it can be very useful to see this data. For
this reason, mu4e can log all these messages. Note that the 'protocol'
is documented to some extent in the mu-server manpage.

   You can enable (and disable) logging with `M-x mu4e-toggle-logging'.
The log-buffer is called *mu4e-log*, and in the *note Main view::,
*note Headers view:: and *note Message view::, there's a keybinding <$>
that takes you there. You can quit it by pressing <q>.

   Logging can be a bit resource-intensive, so you may not want to
leave it on all the time. By default, the log only maintains the most
recent 1200 lines. mu itself keeps a log as well, you can find this it
in <MUHOME>/log/mu.log, typically ~/.mu/log/mu.log.

     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
